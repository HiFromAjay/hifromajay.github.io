<div style="text-align: justify"> <b>Bio:</b> I am an Assistant Professor at North Dakota State University. 
Prior to joining NDSU, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher for over two years at the University of Alberta and three years at Kyungpook National University. 
I earned both my Masterâ€™s degree (2013) and Ph.D. (2017) from Kyungpook National University under the supervision of Prof. Woo Jin Lee. 
Before pursuing graduate studies, I spent over five years in the software industry, where I co-founded two startups and served as a business development manager in two organizations.
 I have also served as a session chair, program committee member, and reviewer for prestigious conferences and journals, 
  including MSR, FSE, ASE, SANER, ICSME, MobileSoft, ICSE, TSE, and EMSE. Further details are available in my <a href="doc/CV_Ajay.pdf" target="_blank"><b>CV</b></a> (Updated Jan 11, 2025).
