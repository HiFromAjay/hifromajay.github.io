<div style="text-align: justify"> <b>Bio:</b> I am an Assistant Professor at North Dakota State University. Before joining NDSU, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher for more than 2 years at the University of Alberta in the
 <a href="https://sarahnadi.org/smr/" target="_blank">SMR lab</a> led by Prof. Sarah Nadi. Before that, I worked as a 
 Postdoctoral Researcher for 3 years at Kyungpook National University in the <a href="http://selab.knu.ac.kr/dokuwiki/doku.php" target="_blank">ESE Lab</a> 
 led by Prof. Woo Jin Lee. I obtained both my Master's degree (2013) and Ph.D. degree (2017) from Kyungpook National University 
 under the supervision of Prof. Woo Jin Lee. Before joining my Master's program, I worked in the software industry for more than 5 years
 as a software developer, project manager, and business development manager.
 I have served as a program committee member and reviewer of various esteemed conferences and journals 
  such as MSR, FSE, ASE, SANER, ICSME, MobileSoft, ICSE, TSE, and EMSE.

 <b>Research Interest:</b> I am interested in software engineering, specifically software testing and maintenance. 
 I work in various research areas including but not limited to the following research areas. <br> 
 ðŸ‘‰<b><i>Test Recommendation and Reuse:</i></b> Writing tests from scratch is difficult and time-consuming. 
 To ease the process of writing tests, I develop techniques to recommend tests that can be used as a starting point for 
 developers to write tests manually. Furthermore, I develop tools and techniques to reuse the recommended tests automatically.<br>
 ðŸ‘‰<b><i>Test Maintenance:</i></b> Test suite evolution is a natural process for any active software system, 
 mainly due to changes in the production code. However, the maintenance and execution of a large number of tests are 
 resource-intensive and costly. Therefore, I develop techniques to remove obsolete and redundant tests and repair broken tests.<br>
 ðŸ‘‰<b><i>Bug Collection, Characterization, and Detection:</i></b> Users are likely to abandon any software system that 
 has critical bugs. Therefore, to help developers in preventing, detecting, and fixing critical bugs, I collect and characterize various types of critical bugs and develop tools and 
 techniques to detect those bugs.<br>
