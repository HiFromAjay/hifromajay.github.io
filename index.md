<div style="text-align: justify"> I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Alberta in the
 <a href="https://sarahnadi.org/smr/" target="_blank">SMR lab</a> led by Prof. Sarah Nadi. Before that, I worked as a 
 Postdoctoral Researcher for 3 years at Kyungpook National University in <a href="http://selab.knu.ac.kr/dokuwiki/doku.php" target="_blank">ESE Lab</a> 
 led by Prof. Woo Jin Lee. I obtained both my Master's degree (2013) and PhD degree (2017) from Kyungpook National University 
 under the supervision of Prof. Woo Jin Lee. Before joining my Master's program, I worked in software industries for more than 5 years.
 My main research interest is software engineering, with a special interest in mobile apps. 
 Specifically, I am interested in software testing, program analysis, empirical software engineering, and mining software repository.
