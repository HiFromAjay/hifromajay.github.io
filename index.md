<div style="text-align: justify"> <b>Bio:</b> I am an Assistant Professor at North Dakota State University. Before joining NDSU, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher for over two years at the University of Alberta in the
 <a href="https://sarahnadi.org/smr/" target="_blank">SMR lab</a>, led by Prof. Sarah Nadi. Before that, I worked as a 
 Postdoctoral Researcher for three years at Kyungpook National University in the <a href="http://selab.knu.ac.kr/dokuwiki/doku.php" target="_blank">ESE Lab</a>, 
 led by Prof. Woo Jin Lee. I earned both my Master's degree (2013) and Ph.D. (2017) from Kyungpook National University 
 under the supervision of Prof. Woo Jin Lee. Before pursuing my Master's, I worked in the software industry for over five years
 as a software developer, project manager, and business development manager.
 I have served as a program committee member and reviewer for prestigious conferences and journals, 
  including MSR, FSE, ASE, SANER, ICSME, MobileSoft, ICSE, TSE, and EMSE.
