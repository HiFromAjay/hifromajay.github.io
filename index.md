<div style="text-align: justify"> <b>Bio:</b> I am an Assistant Professor at North Dakota State University. 
Prior to joining NDSU, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher for over two years at the University of Alberta and three years at Kyungpook National University. 
I earned both my Masterâ€™s degree (2013) and Ph.D. (2017) from Kyungpook National University under the supervision of Prof. Woo Jin Lee. 
Before pursuing graduate studies, I spent over five years in the software industry, where I co-founded two startups and served as a business development manager in two organizations.
 I have served as a session chair, program committee member, and reviewer for prestigious conferences and journals, 
  including MSR, FSE, ASE, SANER, ICSME, MobileSoft, ICSE, TSE, and EMSE. You can find more information about me in my <a href="doc/CV_Ajay.pdf" target="_blank"><b>CV</b></a> (Updated Aug 22, 2024).
